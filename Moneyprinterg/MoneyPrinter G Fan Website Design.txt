MoneyPrinter G — Header Redesign Specifications (A/B/C)
Last updated: 2025-10-29

Overview
- Goal: Modern, responsive header that improves navigation clarity, branding prominence, and utility access while keeping existing functionality intact.
- Deliverables: Three fully functional prototype variants implemented in the site source.
  - Variant A: Minimal horizontal bar (index.html)
  - Variant B: Centered stacked layout with tagline (header-b.html)
  - Variant C: Brand-left layout with mega-menu (header-c.html)

Design Principles
- Consistency: Adhere strictly to existing color palette and typography.
- Hierarchy: Brand → Primary nav → Utilities (search, CTA, language).
- Accessibility: Keyboard navigable; visible focus states; proper aria labels.
- Performance: Lightweight animations; no layout thrash; avoid blocking scripts.

Branding
- Logo: High-resolution image with responsive scaling in `.brand-logo`.
- Name: `Inter` font, 600–800 weight, legible sizes by breakpoint.
- Optional tagline: Shown in Variant B under brand.

Navigation
- Clear labels: Home, Music, Events, Media, About, Subscribe.
- Active state: Applied via JS based on hash; visible indicator under link.
- Mega-menu (Variant C): Displays under Music with grouped links; hover/focus shows menu; ESC or blur closes.

Utilities
- Search: Integrated field with predictive suggestions panel; keyboard and mouse friendly.
- CTA: Primary action “Listen”; secondary “Subscribe” styled as outline.
- Language: Dropdown `EN/ES` placeholder; designed for future i18n.

Responsive Breakpoints
- Mobile (≤640px): Collapsed nav behind menu toggle; utilities moved into mobile panel.
- Tablet (641–1024px): Horizontal nav; utilities right-aligned; balanced spacing.
- Desktop (≥1025px): Full layout; mega-menu available (Variant C); hover interactions enabled.

Spacing & Rhythm
- Header padding: 12–20px depending on breakpoint.
- Nav item spacing: 10–14px; utilities gap: 10–12px.
- Use consistent 4px baseline grid for micro-spacing.

Interaction & Motion
- Hover/focus: Subtle color transition (160ms ease) and underline indicator.
- Menu toggle: Morph icon with rotate/scale; prevents scroll when mobile menu open.
- Shrink-on-scroll (Variant B): Header height compresses slightly after 64px scroll.
- Mega-menu (Variant C): Delayed open/close (80ms) to avoid flicker.

Accessibility
- `aria-label`s on nav/search/menu; `role=listbox/menu` where appropriate.
- Focus management: Trap within open mobile menu; ensure ESC closes mega-menu.
- Contrast: Maintain WCAG AA for text and indicators against header background.

Implementation Notes
- CSS: See `styles.css` header section and variants `.variant-b` / `.variant-c`.
- JS: See `script.js` header module for active states, search, language, mega-menu.
- HTML: Variant A `index.html`, Variant B `header-b.html`, Variant C `header-c.html`.

Prototype Links (local)
- Variant A: `index.html`
- Variant B: `header-b.html`
- Variant C: `header-c.html`

Testing Checklist
- Keyboard: Tab through header; ENTER on links; ESC closes menus.
- Mobile: Open/close menu; scroll behavior; touch targets ≥40px.
- Search: Type partial keywords; suggestions appear; arrow keys navigate.
- Language: Dropdown focus-able; selection retained per session (placeholder implementation).

Future Enhancements
- Real i18n with persisted language setting.
- Server-backed search with weighted scoring.
- Analytics events on menu interactions and CTA clicks.
